      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous
      proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are
      large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth
      modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.
      Only two genera,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant" target="_blank"
        ><em>Loxodonta</em></a
      >
      (African elephants) and 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas" target="_parent"><em>Elephas</em></a>
       (Asian elephants), are living.
    </p>

      The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later
      assigned to taxonomic ranks within the order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has
      been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct
      proboscidean genera.
